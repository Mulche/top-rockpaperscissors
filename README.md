A simple console-based Rock Paper Scissors game made in JavaScript.

My pseudocode is as follows:

1. Have "computer" randomly select rock, paper, or scissors
2. Prompt user to select their choice
3. Run a series of conditionals to determine the winner
4. Increment a score variable for the winner
5. Repeat rounds until the player or the computer have 5 wins
